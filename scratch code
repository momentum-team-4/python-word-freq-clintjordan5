list of previous ideas/attempts outside of python file to revise


    # lowercase = removePunctuation.lower()
    # split = lowercase.split()
    
    combined these functions into one called 'text_formatting' that removes symbols and replaces with empty string
 

    frequency = {}
    for word in output:
        frequency[word] = frequency.get(word, 0) + 1
        return frequency
    # get the frequency of words used in text file, referencing the above output function
    
    simplified this using keys

    def word_count(str):
        count = dict()
        words = str.split()

    for word in words:
        if word in count:
            count[word] += 1
        else:
            count[word] = 1

    return count
    simplified this by using for loop and tested with print in terminal

    # join.filter string.alnum
